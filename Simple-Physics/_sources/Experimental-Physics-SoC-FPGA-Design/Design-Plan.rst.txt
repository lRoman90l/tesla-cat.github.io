Design Plan
============================

Note
---------

- This is originally a project documentation, some files mentioned in this series can be found at `this GitHub repo of mine`_

What are we gonna do?
-------------------------

- The Cyclone V SoC FPGA can be used as **sequencer, counter** etc. for the lab
- The FPGA passes the data it collected to the HPS processor via FIFO, the processor has a server running on it, so any client can get the data via XML http request etc.
- The client can also send data, through processor server, to control the FPGA
- We will use DE10-NANO Dev Board to do the above:

Front End
---------------

Technologies Used:

- Bootstrap 4
- Plotly.js

Notes:

- If the project scales, I will use **React.js** or **Vue.js**, but currently there is no such need

Back End
----------------

Technologies Used:

- Node.js / Python as server

Quartus Project
----------------------

Uses Cyclone V SoC: HPS (processor) + FPGA

What I'm already familiar with:

- C
- Verilog
- Quartus

What I need to learn:

- Communication between HPS and FPGA
