Talking To Girls
=================================

:Date: 24 Aug 2019

Motivation
--------------

- Personally, I experienced many failures when trying to talk to girls. Often ended up being unfriended without having any clue why
- I have made up my mind to identify the mistakes I made
- I will analyze, in the physicist way, how to improve on these mistakes  

What is the problem ?
-------------------------

**Weaknesses:** 3 reality that makes it difficult for Physics Guys to talk to girls

- Physicists think **Too** logically. It is already a common perception that guys think based on **Goal** (logical), whereas girls think based on **Emotion**, this is even more true for a physics guy
- There are usually much more guys in the physics department than girls, there aren't enough chances to get along with girls
- Admit it, most physics guys are nerds who thinks about math everyday and pay little attention to their appearance, and "we" never go to gym

**Strengths:**

- Physics guys are, at least often perceived as, smart
- "We" are Philosophers: thinking deep are usually very charming
- I have no proof but, physics guys are often funny, regardless of being serious or not, "we" often sound funny
- Physics guys are dedicated to work: being focused are usually very charming

Einstein's Theory Of Talking To Girls
------------------------------------------

**Step 1** Kill, or at least hide your weaknesses. Take advantage of your strengths

- Are you giving the impression that you live a substantial life?
- Are you looking clean today?

**Step 2** **Equilibrium** means **Stability**

- When a guy approaches a girl, of course it is because he is attracted by her, 100% logic. It is very natural to think "I am so attracted by her, I wish I could be with her someday"
- Stop the **imagination** and **Calm yourself down!** You must **NOT** think of her as your "potential future girlfriend", because it is very likely that she doesn't give a shit about you, because she doesn't know you!
- **At any given time**, the way you perceive each other should be **In Equilibrium**, as you know, **Equilibrium** means **Stability**. When a system is not in **Equilibrium**, usually something breaks. 
	- This means, try to figure out how she perceives you! 
	- If she doesn't give a shit about you, **pretend** you don't give a shit about her!
	- If she shows some interest in you, **DONT** pretend you don't give a shit about her, **DONT** show too much either, show **exactly the same amount of interest** she shows you!

**Step 3** Before you say anything, think!

- Am I talking too much before she replies? Don't send more than 3 messages before she gives a response. Be patient and **Just wait**
- Think in her shoes
	- Read her messages carefully
	- **imagine her messages are your messages**
	- now think What reply would you like to **Hear (Input)**?
	- and What would you want to **Say (Output)** at this point? 
	- Now you can **Guide her, create the chance**, by saying what she would like to **Hear (Input)**
	- so that she can say what she wants to **Say (Output)**
- The physics behind this is simple: **Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world**
- Girls are very emotional creatures and they want to say a lot (**High potential energy**), you just have to figure out what they want to say and guide them, this will unleash the beast (**High potential energy**) within her! 

**Step 4** **At any given time**, Manners are crucial 

- When starting a conversation, **DONT** ask if they are busy, this will give them **pressure**! Again, Think in her shoes!
- During a conversation, if you can't reply to her for a long time, **Do tell her you are busy, avoid keeping her waiting for your response**
- As in **Step 3**, At any given time, analyze her mood! When you sensed that she doesn't have anything to say, either **change the topic** or **end the conversation**. **Never force her to continue an awkward conversation**
