Design-Plan
============================

Note
---------

- This is originally a project documentation, some files mentioned in this series can be found at `this GitHub repo of mine`_

Front End
---------------

Technologies Used:

- Bootstrap 4
- Plotly.js

Notes:

- If the project scales, I will use **React.js** or **Vue.js**, but currently there is no such need

Back End
----------------

Technologies Used:

- Node.js / Python as server

Quartus Project
----------------------

Uses Cyclone V SoC: HPS (processor) + FPGA

What I'm already familiar with:

- C
- Verilog
- Quartus

What I need to learn:

- Communication between HPS and FPGA 

Tutorials I found useful:

- `DE10 Nano User Manual Chapter 7 Examples for using both HPS SoC and FGPA`_
