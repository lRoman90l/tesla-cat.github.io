Load fonts from your own server instead of Google's. GDPR-friendly.

== Description ==

No configuration required, simply activate the plugin and it just works ðŸ™‚

> This is an addon for the [Google Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/olympus-google-fonts/) plugin. It will only rewrite fonts loaded by that plugin.

Hosting Google Fonts locally removes the need for your website to make requests to Google's servers. This can be useful when optimizing performance and also for complying to GDPR requirements.

### How it Works

* Downloads the font files to your /wp-content/uploads folder.
* Replaces the Google references with your own local domain.
* Remove the Google Fonts 'prefetch' resource hints.
